# Welcome to IDHAN's git page
IDHAN is a performance first booru style manager to be run locally on any computer.

Designed from the ground up with modularity in mind IDHAN features many tactics in order to ensure a responsive GUI and optomized backend.

## Performance
As a impatient person myself I made sure that IDHAN would run as fast as possible in almost any situation. The database backend uses Postgresql in order to get the absolute maximum performance I could get my hands on. I use many tools in order to monitor performance and find bottlenecks wherever they are present. Performance before features.

## Development
I use a strict set of practices when I develop, Including nearly a paragraph of compiler flags to ensure that I stick to the C++ standard. I use c++20 in IDHAN and when C++23 arrives I will use that too. As a college student my time to develop will varry wildly. Releases might be anywhere from a few days to a month in between depending on the desired features.
